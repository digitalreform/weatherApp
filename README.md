# weatherApp
A weather app using API (Community Project #2)

*BACKGROUND:
Right after I started learning web development, I joined a Discord Community and this was posted as a community challenge in
community. 
This was a small challenge to do a weather app using API's in plain JavaScript, no frameworks, no libraries.
For Zip Code Search, you need to enter your Zip Code and your Country Code if outside of the US ie "0001,ZA". 
This is due to the API. This code will not be refactored but you are free to use it in any way you want. UPDATE: API keys have
been removed from the code*

USAGE:

If you open the page, you can enter a city name or zip code, and get the weather forcast for the specific city. The weather 
information is retrieved through the weather service API. Also, a Google Map is used to display the location of the city.
